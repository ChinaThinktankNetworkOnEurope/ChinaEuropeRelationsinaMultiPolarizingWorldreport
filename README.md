# China-Europe Relations in a Multi-Polarizing World report

## The China Think-tank Network on Europe (CTNE), initiated by the Center for the European Union and Regional Development at Beijing Foreign Studies University in 2024, is pleased to announce the theme of its 2025 Annual Report:
## “The Emerging ‘New Europe’ amid Triple Polarization”.
## 📖This year’s report seeks to explore the evolving landscape of Europe through three interrelated lenses — Polarising politics, Restructuring of the regional powers, and intensifying of global power game. It will bring together 14 distinguished scholars from 11 Chinese universities and think tanks to offer in-depth analysis of European integration, geopolitics and economics, and the overall trends and prospects of major countries and sub-regions.
## 🔎 Last year’s inaugural report, titled “China-Europe Relations in a Multi-Polarizing World”, examined identity perceptions, economic cooperation, energy transitions, and geopolitical challenges under global multipolarity.
